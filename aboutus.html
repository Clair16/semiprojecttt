                <p>A strong civil society is vital for a healthy society, especially when that society is developing. 
                    We know that in recent years, all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have faced issues such as increasing capacity, 
                    repeated crises, database management, volunteer and resource coordination, fundraising, 
                    communication with donors through new digital media, and more.

                    We are aware that we are constantly experiencing burnout, trying to do good every day, 
                    grappling with the vulnerabilities of our beneficiaries, and surviving in a context of uncertainty marked by 
                    very demanding situations for the entire civil society.
                    
                    But we have solutions to increase our resilience and become more independent. 
                    One such solution is NGO Hub, the result of several years of research in which we, Team From SFIT, 
                    identified the major problems facing non-governmental organizations and then built an ecosystem dedicated to 
                    addressing these issues.
                    
                    NGO Hub is a single point of access where any organization can access a digital solutions ecosystem 
                    that addresses the most pressing needs of NGO life. A dedicated toolkit built by an NGO to support all 
                    NGOs that take care of all of us every day.
